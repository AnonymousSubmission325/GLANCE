                            - Data cleaning: Remove missing values or handle them using imputation techniques.
                            - Handle outliers by capping or removing extreme values.
                            - Standardization or normalization can be used to scale numeric data.
                            - Handle categorical variables through encoding techniques like one-hot encoding.

                            2. Perform feature engineering:
                            - Feature scaling ensures that numeric values are in a comparable range.
                            - Extract important features from raw data for better model performance.

                            3. Data visualization:
                            - Use scatter plots to visualize relationships between two variables.
                            - Histograms help visualize the distribution of numeric data.
                            - Line charts are great for showing trends over time.
                            - Libraries like matplotlib and seaborn are ideal for creating professional visualizations.

                            4. Visualize trends and patterns:
                            - After preprocessing, visualize trends to gain insights and guide further analysis.`

                "content": `Machine learning is a core area of AI where systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions. 
                            In supervised learning, models are trained on datasets with known inputs and outputs. 
                            The process involves providing the system with labeled data, allowing it to map inputs to corresponding outputs accurately.

                            Supervised learning techniques are used for tasks like classification, where the goal is to assign items to categories, 
                            and regression, which predicts numerical values. With enough labeled examples, the system can generalize and predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.`

                            Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, plays a critical role by capturing sunlight, which initiates the reactions in plant cells. 
                            This energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, providing both food for the plant and oxygen for the environment.

                            The process occurs in two stages: the light-dependent reactions, which capture energy from sunlight, and the Calvin cycle, where this energy helps turn carbon dioxide into glucose.`
